This was an idea that popped up out of nowhere since I wanted to understand how optimizers work over a singular loss curve. I have learnt a lot from 3Blue1Brown over the years and the way Grant explains things using his animations is uniquely amazing so I also wished to use Manim to do something in the future. Forgot to pick this up for a long time but finally got around to finishing this project and was able to use Manim for the 2D loss curve visualization and went with matplotlib for the 3D one since it looked far better and was kinda easier to implement.

## TODO
- DONE: Fix weird contour plot for rosenbrock!!!!
- DONE: Convert input(x,y) into ndarray/tensor to show working of optimizers
- DONE: Support baby mode
- DONE: Add more optimizers!!!
- DONE: Plot 3d rosenbrock
